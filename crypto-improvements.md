Each category is ordered by implementation priority and dependency relationships. The improvements build upon each other, with earlier improvements often being prerequisites for later ones.

Would you like me to:
1. Provide detailed specifications for any category?
2. Prioritize specific improvements?
3. Create implementation plans for specific items?
4. Add security analysis for proposed changes?
